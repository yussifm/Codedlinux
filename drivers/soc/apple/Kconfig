	  The PMGR block in Apple SoCs provides high-level power state
	  controls for SoC devices. This driver manages them through the
	  generic power domain framework, and also provides reset support.

	  Apple SART is a simple DMA address filter used on Apple SoCs such
	  as the M1. It is usually required for the NVMe coprocessor which does
	  not use a proper IOMMU.

	  Say 'y' here if you have an Apple SoC.
